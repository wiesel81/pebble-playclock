# PlayClock
by Michael Krenn, American Football official in Austria.

Playclock for American Football officials working as on-field timekeeper based on the NCAA Rules 2016.

With this watchapp it is possible to operate the 40/25 on the field without taking a look at the watch and missing action. It works offline although most of the settings like notifications and vibration patterns are customizable via phone when connected.

Pressing the up- or down-button starts the 40- or 25-second countdown, giving a vibration signal as confirmation.
Pressing one of these buttons long allows to preset the timer, starting it with the select-button.
Pressing the select-button long stops the current countdown or activates standby-mode, which allows to enable/disable vibration using the select-button again.
5 notifications can be configured individually. Per default the playclock sends a vibration signal when 25 seconds left (ball ready?), at 10 and 5 seconds and, of course, when the timer expires.
